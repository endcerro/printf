# printf

A recursive function that would emplement a tab of functions to alleviate the if forest.

The goal of using recursivity is to get the text incoming backwards, and then maybe proceed to changes.

Before each recursive call, may use strjoin
Go at the back while applying specific functions for flags AND args

Then identifiers

When the two strs have been obtained, merge according to configuration.


Return, join, return, join, putstr
